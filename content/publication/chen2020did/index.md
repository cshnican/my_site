abstract: "Blasi et al. (2019) offer evidence that post-neolithic changes in bite configuration,
owed to the adoption of agriculture, have led to the innovation and proliferation of
labiodental consonants in the worldâ€™s languages. Here we investigate the putative
association between agriculture and labiodental consonants via a new approach that
does not rely on phoneme inventories. Given that labiodentals are apparently
characterized by reduced muscular effort in populations with agriculture-influenced
bite configurations, we test whether labiodental sounds are actually more prevalent
in languages whose speakers rely on agriculture. We rely on word lists from the
Automated Similarity Judgement Program (Wichmann et al. 2018), which contains
transcribed lists of common words in thousands of languages. We analyze the
relative frequency of sound types in the word lists of agricultural and hunter-gatherer
populations, respectively, finding differing mean rates of labiodental usage in
populations with distinct subsistence strategies. Using a linear mixed-effects model
to control for relatedness and contact, we find support for an association between the
frequency of labiodental consonants and the use of agriculture"
