abstract: "We test the hypothesis that a specific anatomical feature, the dental
  malocclusion associated with reduced dental wear, causes languages to adapt by
  relying more heavily on labiodental consonants. In contrast to previous work
  on this topic, we adopt a usage-based approach that directly examines the
  relative frequency of such labiodental sounds within phonetically transcribed
  word lists and texts from thousands of languages. Labiodentals are shown to be
  very infrequent in the languages of hunter gatherers, who tend to have
  edge-to-edge bites as opposed to the overbite and overjet observed in
  populations that consume softer diets and rely heavily on eating utensils.
  This strong tendency is evident after controlling for Galtonâ€™s problem via
  multiple methods including frequentist and Bayesian linear mixed modeling.
  Additionally, we discuss data from Amazonian hunter gatherers with
  edge-to-edge bites. The languages of these populations are shown not to use
  labiodentals frequently, or to have only recently begun doing so. Finally, we
  analyze the speech of English speakers with varying bite types, demonstrating
  how the sounds used by individuals reflect the same phenomenon. The diverse
  findings converge on the same conclusion: speech adapts to anatomical
  differences within and across populations."
