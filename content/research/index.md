I'm broadly interested in the question of what made human languages the way they are today. I address this question from a range of perspectives.

## What are the extra-linguistic factors that influence human languages?
Traditionally, scholars held the views that languages are roughly equal in complexity, because it is assumed all languages are roughly equally capable of communication. As a result, it is also assumed there is an internal tradeoff of complexity at different levels, notably syntax and morphology, as if one language is more complex in morphology than another, it is expected to be less complex in syntax than another. My studies added to the literature showing that such trade-off is not driven by internal factors, but rather by external factors such as sociopolitical ones. We showed that languages spoken by more exoteric societies tend to have more complex syntax and simpler morphology, and those spoken by more esoteric societies tend to have more complex morphology and simpler syntax.

## How do language users comprehend implausible sentences?
Using insights from information theory and Bayes theorem, we model sentence comprehension as a rational process: when we encounter a sentence, we consider 1) the probability of an interpretation and 2) the likelihood of such interpretation to result in our perceived signal due to noise. We’ve tested this framework, termed the noisy-channel framework in multiple studies and the results were robust across languages and modalities. My studies contributed to this framework in two ways: we showed that by adding a supportive context, comprehenders are more likely to adopt a more plausible, non-literal interpretation when they encounter an implausible sentence, compared to adding a non-supportive context or no context. In addition, we tested the framework in novel sentence constructions in Mandarin Chinese and obtained similar results as those in English.

## Communicative efficiency of human languages
Language is an important means for humans to communicate with each other. The meaning intended by the speaker is converted to a string of linguistic signals and then is decoded and recovered by the listener in real time. Communication has been taking place possibly for tens of thousands of years, done by billions of people around the world, but how efficient is it? How does language balance the need of accuracy with the need of conciseness? Using tools in information theory, previous studies showed that color naming systems in a diverse set of languages are near optimal in balancing such two needs. We added to the literature by showing spatial demonstratives – a class of words or phrases describing locations (e.g. “here” and “there” in English), are also near optimal.
